In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. However, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesn't quite fit the child class. In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as Method Overriding."],"metadata":{"id":"kN9J1BUN5vUK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class parent:\n","  def house(self):\n","    print('this is parent house')\n","class child(parent):\n","  def show(self):\n","    print('this is show method')\n","  def house(self):\n","    print('this is child house')\n","\n","obj=child()\n","obj.house()\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Aen8wBHD6oG7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721643473163,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":788,"user":{"displayName":"KHUSHI AGARWAL","userId":"07013223308188118296"}},"outputId":"89d435e5-a252-4ecc-fab4-601f7f28bb94"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["this is child house\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class bird:\n","  def intro(self):\n","    print('there are many birds')\n","  def flight(self):\n","    print('most of the birds can fly but some cannot.')\n","\n","class sparrow(bird):\n","  def flight(self):\n","    print('i can fly')\n","\n","class ostrich(bird):\n","  def flight(self):\n","    print('i can not fly')\n","\n","s=sparrow()\n","s.flight()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"oxSq7Tnb7SXh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721643754088,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1766,"user":{"displayName":"KHUSHI AGARWAL","userId":"07013223308188118296"}},"outputId":"b3849c4d-ebc6-492f-d7e9-954799918e64"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["i can fly\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","# Encapsulation"],"metadata":{"id":"pGtxDOD3_IYV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"lotXZq629WCP"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
